Matt: [00:00:00] We need to make sure we have the highest Fidelity audio so you can talk about my air fryer. We're back here with yet another episode of Quiche-Anon, your favorite podcast about conspiracy theories and food, possibly the only podcast about those two things, but that doesn't mean you can't call us your favorites. I'm Matt. 

Kelli: [00:00:26] And I'm Kelli.

Matt: [00:00:27] Before we dig into the way so that you think that's going to be a pun about the topic before we dig into. But it's not before. Before we dig into the the the topic, I thought we would share that. If you are an Instagram type person, you can now follow us on the Instagram's. The account name is Quiche-Anon. There's a link to it on our website. I like Kelli gave me a look like she was thinking for a second, like we know you said it wrong, but that was like, oh no, wait. That's right. That is what it is.

Kelli: [00:00:56] No, I'm so sorry. I think I was just making sure I did that correctly when I created it last night.

Kelli: [00:01:03] I had we both had a minor simultaneous freakout that none of you got to see because this is an audio podcast. Uh, I don't know if you knew that when you're listening that you can't actually see us.

Kelli: [00:01:13] If you weren't aware, be aware of that. I'm going to probably cut that out.

Matt: [00:01:17] So tonight, we are going to talk about what is actually my favorite conspiracy's, because it just doesn't make any sense to me. And it is about the lunar landing. And did it actually happen?

Kelli: [00:01:32] Did it? We might never know.

Matt: [00:01:34] I have a friend of mine who used to work is like a sound engineer in movies. And I was visiting him on the lot one time and he was showing me around. And I'm pretty sure the set we walked by, he was it was probably for the Tom Hanks from the Earth to the moon, but it was a set from that. He's like, yep, that's where we faked the lunar landing as we walk past that set. And I was I always think about that. But and then maybe there's a little bit to it. I don't know, Kelli, let's let's find out. Did we really go to the moon?

Kelli: [00:02:00] I don't know. Did we? It's hard to say. Some claim we have fifty years of evidence stating that we did indeed land on the moon. And other people want you to know that it was all a lie from the beginning. So July 20th, nineteen sixty nine at three seventeen pm Eastern Time, Americans landed on the moon for the very first time, which this is the part that always gets me because I don't understand this at all. But it was like a huge victory against the Soviets that we made it to the moon first. And I'm so far removed from that era. It just it does not compute that getting to the moon would have been like a victory over the USSR.

Matt: [00:02:36] Well, the concern was that the Soviets would put a military base there or something like that. But there's also kind of a psychological component to it. Right. Which is, you know, the idea of what they call a red moon, you know, like if the moon is is Soviet and that's hanging over you all the time. And there's there's actually just that to go off too much of a tangent. There is a Hamlyn, a Robert Heinlein kind of short story. I guess it is. It's kind of a long, short service called The Man Who Sold the Moon. And it's obviously it was written before we allegedly went to the moon for real. But the story is about what the first moon landing would be. And the guy is basically the predecessor to Elon Musk. I think now that I realize this did Harriman, but he was trying to raise money because it was a private enterprise. And first he goes and he's actually and they don't use these names. But fundamentally, imagine that he was going to try to raise money from Pepsi-Cola and he showed them like he basically the way he scared them was like saying, well, if you don't, I'm going to get money from Coke and we're going to, like, engrave Coca Cola's logo on the moon. So everybody will see the Coke logo every night when they look up. And then later when he's trying to get investment or something from the US government, he's giving the same argument, but showing the hammer and sickle as if that would happen. Like if the Soviets got there first, they would like graffiti the moon to be their logo or whatever, but maybe not that specific literalness. But that's the idea of Red Moon, right, is that you have this thing over your head all the time. And the thought that it would be Soviet was really scary. So we had to get there. I mean, that was the thing, right, that the thought was get there first because of the psychological component of that.

Kelli: [00:04:25] Yes, that's all I actually get into that and the psychology of why it was such a big deal. But you're all absolutely correct.

Matt: [00:04:32] Sorry for the spoiler. 

Kelli: [00:04:34] Spoiler alert. But I do just want to mention now that you bring it up, I would love it if the moon was in like grave with the Coca-Cola logo. I would go outside and stare at the moon every single night. I don't do that now, but I would if it had the Coke logo. Pepsi is terrible. The moon landing was in 1969, but still today these theories are obviously very, very popular. The most recent opinion polls were taken in two thousand nine or the most recent ones that I could find. And it showed that 20 percent of Americans. Twenty five percent of people in the UK and twenty eight percent of Russians still believe the moon landing.Were faked,

Matt: [00:05:10] Like that's a big percentage of people that is like outlandish that that many people that it's that prevalent because with a lot of this stuff, we sit there and we're like, OK, it's like a fringe thing. But that's like more than fringe.

Kelli: [00:05:24] I think it is more than fringe. So I think it's important to remember that these were I don't know what questions were asked in these polls. So this could have been like, do you believe that some landings were faked or I don't know what they asked data or some of the information wasn't.

Matt: [00:05:40] Yeah, yeah. I mean, like something was fake.

Kelli: [00:05:42] So I can't be quite sure what they asked. But I do know that five to six percent of people in more recent studies but studies, I couldn't verify who did them or how many people were in them show around five to six percent, like seriously believe that space travel has all been faked. And it's just a made up thing we funnel money to. In two thousand one, Fox aired a documentary called Conspiracy Theory. Did We Land on the Moon, in which they did a whole entire documentary about how we faked the moon landing to beat the Soviets? This was in 2001. They are still showing these things on air. It's just kind of wild to me.

Matt: [00:06:16] Well, and you think about it like a mainstream showing of that. And again, in a a I don't want to say pre Internet time, but before as people were is extremely online, that's exposing that idea to a lot of people that before I would imagine like before that time, you know, kind of in the pre Internet era or the early Internet era, you'd have to do some digging into some weird, like photocopied zines that someone was handing out on a street corner to, like, know about lunar conspiracy landing versus just being a thing that people share in memes on Twitter. So like but that to me, seems like that would be pretty impactful, that people who might believe that but didn't know it was the thing they might want to believe now suddenly could latch onto it.

Kelli: [00:07:04] Well, you're exactly right. And actually, the moon landing conspiracy theories are kind of famous for being the movie Conspiracy. It was the first conspiracy that the information wasn't disseminated largely through like books or club or group meetings, like local Mason meetings or whatever. And it was all tied in with movies like every conspiracy is tied in with at least one movie. However, you are correct, the popular moon landing was faked theories. Now they've been around since the moon landing occurred. This is not a new conspiracy at all. But in 1976, Bill Kaysing, who was, by the way, born in Chicago, a nice local man self published a book. He's Bill Kaysing is a former U.S. naval officer and he self published this book called We Never Went to the Moon How Americans Got Swindled out of 30 Billion Dollars, which, you know, not a bad angle. Catchy title.

Matt: [00:07:55] Yeah.

Kelli: [00:07:56] I mean, that'll make you think in this book he claims that there's a point zero zero one seven percent chance that NASA could have successfully landed on the moon.

Matt: [00:08:05] So you're saying there's a chance. 

Kelli: [00:08:08] You're saying it's a little Dumb and Dumber quote for the night. But so Bill goes on to say that basically he says his the whole premise is that it would have been so much easier to put money, effort and time and resources into faking the moon landing rather than risking going to the moon and not making it, which is what he said would have happened. So that's what his premise largely was. His book also discusses that there were there would have been a problem basically traveling through the atmospheric radiation so that it just the astronauts and the space shuttle just would burn up in this wall of radiation, which I accept that they didn't. But, you know, no, no, they did it. He claims in this book that NASA lacked technical expertize. There was an absence of stars and a lunar landing photos, which is proof of a hoax. So this is a huge thing that moon landing deniers, I guess, as we should call them, claim is that why are there no stars and all these photos?And I'll kind of go kind of through it. The Metrobus, those.Yeah, the research was kind of scattered on this one. It's not my best research organizationally, so everyone's just going to have to deal with it.

Matt: [00:09:21] Just come along on the journey with us listeners.

Kelli: [00:09:24] You know, who knows what I was doing when I was researching this podcast? It's hard to say. I was enjoying the movie Capricorn One, which we'll talk about later.

Matt: [00:09:33] It will all come together in the magical tapestry that is Quiche-Anon.

Kelli: [00:09:38] So he also says this is still causing that unexplained optical anomalies. I don't know what that means, really. I don't know. Maybe he thought that was weird. Yeah. Yeah. Which yeah. Who what's your frame of reference, Kaysing. How would you know? And then he says there's an absence of blast craters beneath the lunar modules and the engines would have generated a dust storm that wouldn't have settled for days. But also the day the moon landing happened, Dutch newspapers published articles on the front page of their newspaper saying that this was.

Matt: [00:10:10] I didn't realize that the Dutch were like so into denying, you know, like they were so core to this. So that's that's the thing you never think about when you go to Amsterdam.

Kelli: [00:10:20] I had no idea. But the Dutch newspaper editors had one too many space cakes that night, and they were like, absolutely not. No way did this happen. And we will publish. Bill Keesing also brings up one of my favorite things in all of our conspiracy theories of mysterious death of someone a long, long time ago. So in this case, it was Thomas Baron. Thomas Baron is a man from Pennsylvania, and he was quality control, a.k.a. the Kelli Kapoor of North American aviation and primary contractor to build the Apollo command module. So he is a big time man. Mr. Baron, the National American North American Aviation fired him for a critical safety standard report he leaked. Basically, he wrote this report critical of the Apollo safety measures and Apollo quality control and then testified before Congress being very critical of NASA safety protocol violations. So he testifies against the North American Aviation Association, saying they were not safe, they were not following rules. And then six days later, him and his whole family are killed in a car accident. Woops. Yeah. Who's to say who did that?

Matt: [00:11:31] It was probably the Winter sSldier. 

Kelli: [00:11:33] Kaysing thinks it was NASA, OK. And he says so in his self published book. Should we self publish a Quiche-Anon book?

Matt: [00:11:40] We should, because then we could be we could say to this reference, just cite ourselves every episode.

Kelli: [00:11:46] It would be so much easier for what I'm copying and pasting links at the last moment for you. Bill Kaysing also claims that NASA loves to do a little murder and they just murdered all the astronauts on Apollo one and the Challenger because those astronauts were threatening to expose the hoax.

Matt: [00:12:03] Only those ones. One of the screaming flaws and so much of all of this shadow stuff to me is nobody could keep their damn mouth shut. Right? I mean, and maybe there are people that can, but it is not like the percentage. If you took the entire list of people involved in the space program, that would have to know about this. And to have it only be the crew of Apollo, one of that particular mission and that particular Challenger mission were the only people that that were at a risk to that. It just yeah, it kind of doesn't that doesn't add up. And that will be in my self published book.

Kelli: [00:12:43] That's a good theory. And it tracks. But I think that's something I think about a lot with these cover up conspiracies or stuff like this in general, because there have to be so many people covering it up and agreeing to this. But then I'm like, maybe not with the moon landing. I don't think we faked the moon landing. I want to make that very clear. But like, would I don't know. I think it's very possible that there are cover ups and people are just off to keep them quiet. So, I mean, absolutely there. Yeah.

Matt: [00:13:09] Yeah, there are it's scale is the thing that makes this fall apart. Right. Because am I saying that there are no nefarious things happening, that there are no actual I don't want to say conspiracies, but, you know, like sketchy shit. Yeah. And you know what happens? People do come out about it. Maybe bad things happen to them. But it's still a it's not at the scale of the thing that mobilized the entire country's industrial complex basically for years at a time. There's just too many people and, you know, to to architect around around that. You know, that being said, does that mean that there aren't some things that maybe weren't exactly kosher? You know, I mean, that's the thing. I think it's I think when you want to distill something like this, you pull out the pieces that might not add up, but it doesn't mean that it's part and parcel all completely fake. Right. Because doing that is just too big. It's it's too big for even for the Illuminati.

Kelli: [00:14:08] These things do happen. But when they cherrypick conspiracy theories, cherry pick these little details and try to apply it to these large scale events and it just never would add up. Yeah, there's just like a little detachment from reality sometimes I think when we think there's millions of people covering stuff up. But Kaysing also went on to generally accuse the CIA, the Federal Reserve and the IRS of brainwashing the public, poisoning the food supply and controlling the media. So very chill stuff that casing thought was happening. But Keesing does say that he thinks we can go into outer space. What he thinks happened is we've launched those rockets except for the people we did murders on because they were going to expose us and they just circled the earth and their rocket for days and days and weeks, which would still be for Earth orbit, you know, and just hung out.

Matt: [00:14:53] And then we're like, well, it seems like about the right amount of time for us to have gone to the moon. It's sort of like, you know, when when you're going to you just need to get out of the house, you know, maybe away from your kids or your family. And you claim to run an errand, but you really aren't going to do it. And you just go park like in the target parking lot. For having your like, how this seems about the right amount of time it would take for me to like go to the DMV or whatever, right. So that I can I can head back now.

Kelli: [00:15:16] I don't have children. I do that, too. But I do do that just so I can avoid being productive. I'll just leave and say I have to run errands and go sit in the food court at the Thompson Center, OK? And that's what happens.

Matt: [00:15:27] You're basically an astronaut. That's what you're saying.

Kelli: [00:15:30] They circled the Thompson Center food court for days while they stage the moon landing. So another big, I don't know, impetus for these moon landing theories gaining traction was in 1980. And this is a good topic we're going to be covering soon. In 1980, the Flat Earth Society put out claims in various publications saying that the moon landing was staged by Disney and they were the first one to throw out Kubrick's name as director of the Disney staging.

Matt: [00:15:56] Mean if you're going to get someone to do it, like, you know, aim high, right?

Kelli: [00:16:01] Yeah, get the best. Get the director of Eyes Wide Shut for your project. I know it was before that. OK, guys, do not yell at me. So the biggest motivation, as we touched on at the beginning and maybe man has more to say about this, is that we wanted to beat the Soviets to the space race and we didn't have the technology and we knew we weren't getting it. So we just had to come up with a large scale plan to fake it. People debunked this thing. The Soviets were advanced and would have immediately known that.

Matt: [00:16:27] Why was just going to say, like, you know, I can I could even if I swallowed the like, you're going to do this to fool the pop the general populace of the US so that you can take their money. It's not like the Russians are just be like, oh, I saw the thing on TV. I guess we got beaten. Pretty sure they were just taking just that part to decide to do what they did.

Kelli: [00:16:49] So it's another online conspiracy theorists. And I didn't write their name down because they didn't care, but they said that the Soviets would have been unable to trace they didn't have a self published book. So that was selfish. But I think they were a guy from Redditt. You know, I don't like to announce those people, but they said that the Soviets didn't have the technology to track our lunar landing until nineteen seventy two, which is why the last three Apollo missions were canceled.

Matt: [00:17:13] However, the distance is like, oh, shit, now they disprove it. I guess we're done.

Kelli: [00:17:18] Well, pack it up, boys. It's time to go. We're going to start the war on drugs, OK? We got to get out of here. But so the this theory is debunked completely because the Apollo missions were canceled in 1970 for budgetary reasons. So it wouldn't have mattered. And I don't think any of that B.S. is true. NASA faked the moon landing to increase the budget of NASA. I don't know, to take more money for themselves, which is really the most believable one.

Matt: [00:17:46] But the problem with that to a point, NASA exists for the moon that the space race was always about getting to the moon. Like every single thing we did in the pre Apollo missions were precursors to Apollo. Right. It wasn't like we were doing a bunch of space shit. And then we're like, you know what would be cool to do next? Let's go to the moon. Right.

Kelli: [00:18:06] It was all leading up to that.

Matt: [00:18:08] So NASA wouldn't. And again, that doesn't mean I'm sure a conspiracy theorist would be like, well, but I mean, that's of course, that was all part of it. But I'm like, it's not like they were an existing thing that we're like, how can we get some more money? They were created to do that. And then maybe they were created to do that, to take the money.

Matt: [00:18:25] But like, you know, that's I really like early space history stuff. I mean, space shuttle stuff is cool and ISIS is cool and everything, but especially Apollo. I wouldn't say I'm obsessed with it, but I really, really like it.

Matt: [00:18:38] And this is my pitch for if you maybe if you believe was faked or not, maybe if you believe the lunar landings are faked. Here's a good fictional series to watch or not. And it's on. It was produced by HBO. Tom Hanks produced it and it's called From the Earth to the Moon. And it was I think and listeners may correct me if I get the order wrong. I believe it came out after Apollo 13, you know. I mean, so it's sort of like not capitalizing on that. But that was something Tom Hanks got interested in. Whatever. And so it's a miniseries and it basically tracks the Apollo program, starting with in the first episode, it's called Red Moon. And it's kind of talking about how it happened. And there's a whole bunch like you watch this thing, you're like, oh, they're in it. And there's a bunch of really interesting episodes. There's one that focuses on, like the experience for the astronauts wives, what that was like there. Apollo 13 episode is actually really good because they didn't need to dig into what actually happened because there was a feature film. But it was really about and something I didn't realize is a lot of what we think of as modern journalism, almost sensationalism, really came to bear during Apollo 13 because there were a lot of journalists that were like, you know, they kind of camped out on the astronauts homes and to, like, talk to the families. And that was just not done before. You know, it was sort of the old guard was like, you respect the people who are involved. You don't get in their face and whatever. And Jay Moore plays kind of a jackass like new new school journalist. As you can imagine, he was quite good at. And the reason that I'm telling everybody it was unobvious. On any kind of streaming for the longest time, like when HBO GO first came out at everything I like was in a mad dash to watch from the Earth to the moon. And it wasn't there. It wasn't there. And it only I'd say now within the last, I think was a couple of years ago. But you can get it on HBO streaming now and it's it's super good. So check it out.

Kelli: [00:20:26] I actually added it to my list as you were talking, so I will check it out because I also have the movie Apollo 13 came out when I was about seven or eight. I think I kind of grew up in a post space kind of not war world, obviously, but it was was like post shuttle Challenger and it was definitely post space, obviously post space race. It was the nineties. So Apollo 13 was a really awesome movie that we all kind of knew nothing about this whole space race. And it did get me really interested as a kid and reading about the space race history and kind of understanding that these men were all just really military pilots who got involved in this kind of crazy program.

Matt: [00:21:04] They're remaking The Right Stuff as a as a series. And I don't remember what it's on you. Can you all have the Internet? Go find it. The Right Stuff is a great movie, but I'm really excited about this. The series, which I don't really know when it's coming out, but I keep getting Twitter ads for it every now and again. And it reminds me. And then I'm like, oh, it's not out yet. Both for me it's like it's the tech is really interesting, kind of like the challenges that they had to solve to do this. And there's a lot of really serendipitous stuff where it's just like we don't know what we're doing and we think it might be this and then, but also so much of the psychology and how our American experience was different around something like this than it would be today. You know, the national identity connected to it, how much, you know, Kennedy was connected to it. And then it's just really, really fascinating to me how how much of a thing this was and then thinking about all the people that did something with it. Right. Like I mean, there were so much that goes back to like, how the hell do you lie about all this? There was everybody was doing that, obviously not everybody. But there's so many people and have stories about like, oh, my grandfather, like was the engineer that designed the landing pads or something. And oh, I'm really embarrassed because I have a friend who that's the story. Right. It's like her grandfather was like an engineer on the lam, you know, and it's a whole thing. And maybe she listens, maybe she doesn't, because I think I remember who it is. And it's you tell me and I'm sorry that I'm forgetting that it's actually you, but I think I know who it is. But I don't want to say your name because I might be wrong. Lunar landing stuff, Apollo program stuff is super duper interesting. And yeah, I don't remember what we were. Oh we're talking about. Oh you're going to have a Kubrick faking it though, right. Because well we yeah.

Kelli: [00:22:50] We're going to get into Kubrick faking it. But you also touch on a really good point is that the moon landing in 1969 was really still one of the earlier events that the world got to watch on TV together at the same time. So it did create this kind of different cultural phenomenon, which is partially why it immediately spawned so many conspiracy theories, because it was something that was common to everyone and it was easy. It was just an easy thing for people to glom onto, I think, and create stories about because it was an obsession, because when I imagine now, if we are just constantly all getting one channel of the same thing around the whole world, then no options. It would be just insanity every day. But I was going to go through and touch on a lot of the conspiracy theories, point to the photographs and the technology used as why it was faked. So I was going to go through and kind of do some myth busting, little debunking. A little debunking.

Matt: [00:23:44] Yeah, I'm interested because I've read about this. I want to see which ones do you see if there's any that I haven't heard about or seen and not that I'm a super expert in it, but out of out of most of these topics. This is one that I like. I might know a little bit more about, or at least I have read. It's exciting. I'm excited.

Kelli: [00:24:00] Well, the first one is the crosshairs, which is the grid on a filtered lens, if that makes sense. It didn't make super sense to me, but it was basically it would be like the grid I'm doing hand motions is like catching a little crosshatching on the the lens to put it into focus, like, OK.

Matt: [00:24:17] Yep. Right, right, right. Yeah, yeah.

Kelli: [00:24:19] So in a lot of the photos you can kind of see the crosshairs behind the objects and all the cameras used for the moon landing were fitting with a scout riscoe plate I don't know, which is a clear glass plate with a etching on it. I'm doing terrible this. But anyway it looks like the objects were pasted over the crosshairs that you can see in the photos. But in the original photos, these aren't present and it's just due to copying and scanning and bleed through because it's a technology artifact degradation through.

Matt: [00:24:49] Yeah, absolutely. And then not digital information. Yeah. So it can degrade. Right, exactly.

Kelli: [00:24:55] And I, I really think a lot of the people online are younger and do not understand sometimes enough that they don't understand, but. 

Matt: [00:25:01] They don't understand how free copies of a copy because if you didn't grow up with a dual tape deck of making copies or make. Copies of VHS tapes. This doesn't make any sense to you, but if you did, you 100 percent know that's why you don't make a copy of the copy, but you can totally make a copy of a digital copy, and it's exactly the same. So, yeah.

Kelli: [00:25:20] So then the other one, the big one is that the crosshairs are rotated in the wrong place, but it's due to crops and rotations like in the original images. None of this is present.

Matt: [00:25:29] It's just sort of like the cleaned up or like made to look nicer.

Kelli: [00:25:32] Right. And then conversely, some people claim the photo quality is much too high for that era. And they wouldn't have been able to get clear images, which no one can really debunk other than to say they were using obviously top of the line.

Matt: [00:25:48] Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry that it's a little bit better than it's sort of like when they're like, you know, I'm sure there's conspiracy's around. There's no way that modern military could specify the specific location via GPS. But you're like, no, by the way, you know, the military has a better GPS than your car.

Kelli: [00:26:02] You know, we're not they're not using OnStar or like whatever to find targets, whatever. People get it together, OK? They didn't give them, like, Kodak cameras to go to the moon with. Maybe they were Kodak branded. It was actually a but you know what I mean. They did not take their, like, instant Polaroid to put it right. Yeah. See, I hope to send it back.

Matt: [00:26:23] It wasn't like that little one ten film called The Flash, cute rotating flash cube.

Kelli: [00:26:28] They didn't have to, like, go back to the Earth and wait for it to develop for a little while to see what they got. That's not how it was going down on the moon. And the other big one, as I mentioned earlier, was that there's no stars. And I actually basically there there were stars, but they didn't come up in the picture. And it just looks different from the moon at Earth because of reflections and because there's no atmosphere.

Matt: [00:26:48] Right. That's why Stars Twinkle, for example. Right. Is it's the it's the it's refracts with the sphere. So it's. Did you see the one about the waving flag.

Kelli: [00:26:57] Yeah, I'm getting to. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There's like thirty of these map. Oh OK. I this podcast is going to be five hours. Four of it is going to be photography detail. All right. And you're all just going to have to deal with it. I know. So another one is that the there's identical backgrounds in the photos that the photos were allegedly taken one mile apart. But who I don't know how anyone would prove that. And the debunking was basically like, this is stupid. It was just blank space at the moon, like there was nothing for you to see. And then someone also said, and it kills me because it's just like a random Internet lady. And she's like, I know more than NASA. So what I have to tell you is that the number of photos taken was too high. They basically claim that. So how it happened was when they were on the moon photographing this, it was being sent back to Earth via whatever, I don't really know, radio, OK? She was claiming that they would have had to take one picture every, like, twenty seconds and have it sent back for it to have worked. But she didn't count that there were five separate photographers, right. Yeah, there were three like three actual photographers and then two like cameras in the lunar module I believe it was.

Matt: [00:28:11] So there was that was there was one photo. Yeah.

Kelli: [00:28:14] Yeah exactly. It was love that she didn't think that. I love that she thought they sent one camera to the moon.

Matt: [00:28:20] But Buzz Aldrin is not walking around with, like, his Instamatic, you know, like hottest ticket there.

Kelli: [00:28:25] Maybe he'll throw the peace sign that they did rock, paper, scissors for who got the good camera and the other two astronauts had to be. Wow. So this is a good one because this goes into the movie, one that will get into it a little bit. But someone claims to see that there are two letters, CS etched in a moon rocks, and that is studio props.

Matt: [00:28:45] Oh, or it's like a working copy for putting Coke's logo on the moon,

Kelli: [00:28:50] Which I really want to happen now. But I think that was one of the CES was just like a photographic material from here. And again, sorry, most of this is just people not realizing that when they're looking at a photo posted online, it's like the ten thousand copy of a copy of a copy and it's been edited for magazines and then they try to digitize stuff. So then they make it, they make different crops and edits. So this was a funny one, though, that I had never heard before. And I want to know if you've heard it before. So several residents of Perth, Australia, said they saw a Coke bottle roll across the bottom right of the screen and like dozens of residents in Perth, did report this, but it was only in Perth. So I'm inclined to think and the debunking is that it was their local production company, like how they were airing it.

Matt: [00:29:34] Well, they guess the movie The Gods Must Be Crazy came out after the moon landing, so it couldn't couldn't have been influenced by that.

Kelli: [00:29:39] But yeah, I mean, when they were all from Perth, Australia is it's pronounced Perth. I don't know. I have to start looking at pronunciations of that. Julie and I just just haven't gotten it together yet. Then there's the theory that Bill Keesing put out that astronauts couldn't have survived the radiation, the Van Allen radiation belt and more so that the cameras couldn't have survived. But like you said before, they just kind of did so well. That's a great theory. And other people claim like the moon surface would have. To the camera and I'm like, again, you guys, NASA really figured this out before they went, they weren't going to leave it to chance. They figured out how to make a camera that could work on the moon as best they could.

Matt: [00:30:18] I mean, that's sort of a little bit like and not to discount, like all these things we're talking about were things that people would be worried about and part of in some of the case. The only way that we knew that they did it right is that these astronauts didn't die. You know what I mean? Like, I mean, that's that's that's pretty pretty. I'm not saying that, like, modern space travel is, like not heroic or risky or anything, but you think about, like, mercury missions, like, so much of that was like, we don't know what will happen if somebody goes outside the space capsule. We think there's no way to test it except to be like, let's test it and we have to test. So, I mean, yeah, that's that's another part of like what really gets me about all of this is just like that's just so gutsy with a lot of these early astronauts where it was just like I guess this is how we'll find out, because all these things that the theorists bring up as to why it didn't work, they're grounded in concerns. But like like, yeah, that's a thing that might have happened. And they had contingency around it. But the only way to know was to actually do it, if you like.

Kelli: [00:31:18] There's a little bit of this to like. So I work in hospitals, so I'll be talking to like nurses and doctors about charts or whatever, and they'll be lecturing me because I have to educate my patients on what they need. My point is, I think these moneylending people are a little like me when I'm hearing about medicine and how it works and how the body works, because on paper I'm like, no, this could never work. And then everyone else is like, but you have the human body, you know, like except that it did. It is working. And I'm like, all right, I just believe you.

Kelli: [00:31:46] I also this is I can't remember the book I read, but I'm going to bring it up anyway. And if I figure it out later, I'll post it to one of our social media, our new Instagram or Twitter or whatever. A lot of this trading did go to the moon was just these military pilots just agreeing to try it. And just even the flight experiments they did here to train for this was just them, like pushing barriers and pushing boundaries and doing things they hadn't done before. And like there were some deaths and training. There were crashes. So it did work because they tried it here first. It wasn't like they didn't know they could break the sound barrier. They didn't know they could get through radiation. These are all things you can test here before you go there. And then you just pray that when you get there, it's legit. So now we get to the thing where the flag is fluttering, but there's no wind on the moon. And would you like to talk about this a little bit?

Matt: [00:32:33] Well, a little bit. I mean, there's not a whole lot to it. But other than just let's talk about physics for a minute. Yeah, that's sort of the theory, as they say, like, OK, well, if you watch the video, you can see that the American flag is is fluttering. It's moving in the wind, which obviously it couldn't do on the moon because there's no air on the moon. So therefore, there's no wind. There's there's none of that. But what there is is the laws of thermodynamics and a body put in motion remains in motion. And you know, how a flag could be put in motion is when you stick it in something and the pole of the flag shakes a little bit.

Matt: [00:33:12] Turns out the attached flag will shake a little bit for a little while. And actually, I think it would shake a little bit longer on the moon because there's no air resistance to slow it down and absorb that kinetic energy and make it stop shaking.

Matt: [00:33:27] So not only is it possible to for that to move on the moon, it actually might like. So if you tried that at home, you know, with your flight, you'd be like, oh, yeah, but it only did it for like a hot second. But that's because that flag that's moving is moving through air, which provides resistance. So is that is that fairly accurate? According to what you saw? There might be more. I don't know.

Kelli: [00:33:48] Yes, but I went with a simpler theory that I knew how to understand and relate to you. Which is which is it? Lunar hoaxers. OK, is there was there a dust storm created by the lunar landing modules or was there no wind on the moon to wave the flag? You pick a lane and stay in it, OK? It can't be both either.

Matt: [00:34:06] The lunar wind does not only affect lunar dust, right?

Kelli: [00:34:10] How we've created a dust storm with this lunar landing module, would you claim would have happened in which the astronauts say there obviously it did happen. So that's why the flag is moving in. My very not expert, simple minded opinion, because I don't understand thermodynamics at all.

Matt: [00:34:24] Basically a body in motion tends to remain in motion. A body at rest remains stays at rest unless it's impacted by something else. So all I'm saying is, if you are if something isn't moving and it's attached to something that moves a little bit, that other thing will probably move a little bit.

Kelli: [00:34:39] That's that's basically that would be nice when I'm laying on my couch and my my phone falls and it's my face because I lose grip. Is that a body at rest is at rest until something impacts it.

Matt: [00:34:53] That's thermodynamics. That's Newtonian physics for you. Thank you.

Kelli: [00:34:58] So then there is another kind of which one is it a pair of reasons why the moon landing was fake.

Matt: [00:35:05] So they are deniers. Cake, eat it. Why not both?

Kelli: [00:35:09] They they want both for sure, because they say that the the astronauts boots made footprints in the moon surface, but the lunar modules made no imprint. So that's a sign it was faked.

Kelli: [00:35:20] But I'm like, how would that be a sign it was faked because they they forgot to fake the imprints from the LEM maybe is what they're trying to say. But also and I could be wrong and I want to understand this because I haven't really heard this one, or at least I don't remember it well enough.

Matt: [00:35:37] The platform of the LEM, the lower stage never left. So are they like how would you see if it left an imprint? Because there would be no imprint because you know where the imprint is under the pads of the lunar lander that you can't see because the damn thing still on the moon, right? I believe that's true.

Matt: [00:35:54] Like nobody went back and got these things and they're still there. Like, if you went to the moon, you'd find all the lower stage of every LEM that landed on the moon because it's still there, because we just you know, we're like, whatever. Someone will come clean this up later. It's sort of like in Mad Men when they go to the picnic and like Don Draper's family, they just throw all the garbage on the grass and walk away from it because it was the 60s. It was a different time.

Kelli: [00:36:17] Who cared about the earth?

Matt: [00:36:18] We are going to the moon or the moon for that factor because they really were littering the moon at this point, you know? So screw you, Mother Moon or whatever the moon equivalent of Mother Earth is.

Kelli: [00:36:28] I just think this makes no sense because I don't I think people are looking at the footprint of the astronauts walking on the moon and acting as if it would still be there today if they went back and not like it was one photograph of a footprint. Like the moon is made of dust. There's little moisture.

Matt: [00:36:43] Right? Well, and say, yeah. And also they walked over and again themselves. And just over time things move. It doesn't move from windstorms or whatever. Are you going to talk about the reflectors?

Kelli: [00:36:56] No, but you can now,

Matt: [00:36:58] OK, this isn't a conspiracy, but this is a debunking thing. So across that one. So again, I'm going to get the detailed not quite exactly right. So listeners, if that's our brand. Thank you. Our brand is something I sort of remember watching on the History Channel one time, but maybe it wasn't on every lunar landing, but at least on several for scientific measurement purposes. There were some like basically for lack of oversimplifying, but reflectors were installed like big reflective panels on the surface of the moon to be used not not to prove that we really went there, although maybe that I vaguely remember that might have actually been a little bit of it.

Matt: [00:37:34] But mostly it was because it was like a way to be able to measure distance are like, OK, we have this thing there and then we can do this.

Matt: [00:37:41] And those things are they are visible and you can see that and you can shoot light at them and get a reflection back. We put a thing on the moon. Right.

Matt: [00:37:50] And you can to this day and it's where we said it was and it's very scientifically measured. But again, always debunked by conspiracy theorists because everybody who is using those reflectors is part of the conspiracy. That's right. They are.

Matt: [00:38:04] Because I can't, like, take my flashlight, although. But that's the thing is it's also one of the things, if I recall correctly, that an amateur astronomer could actually measure. Right. Like, I don't think you can use your at home telescope and see the lunar landing site and see resolution that there's a LEM platform there. But there are like at the at the level of what the average person has available to them. I believe the whole thing is you absolutely can do it with these reflector.

Matt: [00:38:30] Right. Like that's a thing that you don't need, like high powered NASA telescopes to do. You know, it's something that in fact, I wish I remembered more of the detail about it.

Kelli: [00:38:39] I don't have an at home telescope, just binoculars, because I'm real creepy. But yeah. So those were. Oh, wait, no, I have two more. I'm sorry. I forgot. Great. So wait, there's more. But wait, there's two additional loony theories. One was that people didn't understand how there is only a two second delay in communication between the Earth and the moon. But there actually was more than a two second delay in communication, because when the I'm trying to remember, I was just reading this over and trying to get this all straight, but basically, by the time, like NASA command center got the communications from, like the astronauts, they had already entered their response. So it was there was a longer than a two second delay, but it was because NASA was predicting, like what they would have to respond and sending it back like. So as soon as they would get it and notice that it was normal, it would already be sent.

Matt: [00:39:32] Like, I think I think I can get where you can see this. So I, I used to give talks about like how to handle like incidents within tech, like when shit's going bad, like how do you communicate, how do you plan. And Apollo 13 is actually a really good example because all the recordings are available online. So you could listen to the entire Apollo Theater and I think other missions too. But to the recordings of everything that happened and you're hearing Houston talking to the astronauts and everything. And it's it's really interesting for a couple of ways. One is like if you're into like incident command and understanding, like how to work through a problem, it's a. Look like of how they handle it, but it's really kind of crazy that, like shit is going so sideways and they are just like chill as cucumbers. Right. You know, it's just like, OK, what do you got? Give me an update. Give me an update. What do you got? What do you got? But I feel like there's definitely more that like when those things are happening. There's definitely more than two seconds between Houston and the astronauts because that's not one where they're being polite because they really didn't know what the F was going on.

Matt: [00:40:36] Right. And they're kind of dealing with the OK, here's what's happening. Here's the update. Right. And yeah, if you want to be really impressed, you kind of get that impression from the movie, the Ron Howard movie. But you're like, oh, it's a movie. You know, you know, all this thing. Wouldn't people really be freaking out? And I'm sure they were upset. You would never know. And because it was like we have a problem and, you know, the the way you solve it, like when you're in the middle of that, you just you know, if you stay calm, the people around you will stay calm. And they just were going through. Right. And mission commander and exact mission control is just like, give me an update. What do we think it might be? OK, ok, OK. So if you're someone who ever does Internet response and you're whether you're a first responder or in tech or anything like that, like check out the Apollo 13 recordings, that's really, really interesting.

Kelli: [00:41:25] Now, that is a really cool and I might check those out because again, that is when we're preparing like one of my job duties is I work on detox wards. And so when someone's going through a medical detox, we have every scenario, like we have things ready to go for any scenario. So it's like you're not starting from zero. NASA is not like getting this communication and then starting from zero and figuring out a problem and sending something back. It's already there. They just have to you know, they're getting whatever the specific problem is and then they have something ready to go, which is why this was one of the weirder parts of it, like weirder theories about why this wasn't correct, because this seems like very simple logic to get around. But but there's also a bunch of missing tapes from Apollo 11. Again, I don't want to be like Pollyanna and say like nothing happened to these tapes, but they were basically given to like a NASA museum and then they were given back to the capital and given back to the museum. And at some point, like, part of them just went missing. So whether that was on purpose or not, I mean, things go missing, I don't know.

Matt: [00:42:27] And you know what? Maybe there were things on there that were not like I'm not saying like it was the evidence of aliens, but maybe it was,

Kelli: [00:42:33] Oh, I wish it was.

Matt: [00:42:35] Well, they're missing, so we don't know, don't we?

Kelli: [00:42:39] Aren't we finding out about the aliens soon, don't we, because of the covid bill? Don't we get to find out.

Matt: [00:42:44] Right. Right. So maybe that's all going to come out.

Matt: [00:42:46] We will do a special edition,

Kelli: [00:42:48] Breaking news Quiche-Anon. 

Matt: [00:42:49] Yes. Yes, absolutely.

Matt: [00:42:52] I will livestream.

Kelli: [00:42:53] That shit is just me getting fired from my job for running out to record an emergency Quiche-Anon.

Matt: [00:42:59] Exactly.

Kelli: [00:43:01] But that was pretty much all I had for like things people who are not NASA scientists say couldn't have happened and is why the lunar landing was faked. And then I kind of veered my research into movies and pop culture and the moon landing. And then after that, I did a little brief research into whether or not Hitler lives on the moon. And we'll get to that at the end. I don't know. It's hard to say. Stay tuned. It's a little deep tease for whether or not Hitler lives on the moon. So my new favorite film is the 1978 film Capricorn One. It stars OJ Simpson, James Brolin and Sam Waterston as the astronauts of an Apollo mission. It's streaming now on HBO, IMAX, and it's a little over two hours, which goes against my rules for any movie that's not The Godfather or Titanic. You're not supposed to watch it. It's over two hours.

Matt: [00:43:53] This, most of it. Quiche-Anon is now sponsored by HBO, Max, apparently because this is the second.

Kelli: [00:43:58] That's right. And if we've done something. Yes, HBO, you pay us right now. You asked for this.

Kelli: [00:44:06] Telly Savalas was also involved in some way. I don't know. I just got really obsessed with this movie. But basically, people say this is a conspiracy film and it helped propagate conspiracies because basically this is the plot of the movie is that they figure out they can't pull off the mission or they're going to crash or something. So they fake their death, just like we said, or whatever. And then it's about like kind of Elliott Gould, who is kind of foxy looking when he was young, you know, before he went on to be Monica and Ross, his father, Mr. Geller.

Matt: [00:44:35] But, yeah, he does look pretty sexy, drinking directly from a can of condensed milk.

Kelli: [00:44:39] So he did that good, good Friends deep cut. So when the episode where Phoebe is hitting on him, she says she had a she had like a sex dream about him.

Kelli: [00:44:52] It was one of the Thanksgiving episodes.

Matt: [00:44:54] Well, why else would there be condensed milk for him to drink just randomly?

Kelli: [00:44:58] I made a bread pudding this weekend and it had a can of condensed milk. And I was like, this is just what is it?

Matt: [00:45:05] It's like it's basically sugar and milk. I learned that on "Nailed It" last night, you know, they were we're talking about someone putting condensed milk in her cake recipe and like the celebrity guest or whatever the guest judge was like that. That's basically all you're doing is nothing other than adding more sugar.

Matt: [00:45:24] And because condensed milk, you are just sugar and milk does like the person was like, this is my secret weapon.

Matt: [00:45:30] And she was like, or you could just put in sugar.

Kelli: [00:45:34] That was the secret weapon for this bread pudding recipe that was too involved and it wasn't that good. So I'm not going to recommend it to you. Fine listeners.

Kelli: [00:45:41] So the other thing, the other big movie can look back to Hitler, right?

Matt: [00:45:45] Hitler living on the moon is drinking condensed milk out of a can.

Kelli: [00:45:48] That's all he brought because it's shelf stable to go to the moon for 60, 80 years, however long it's been. So Stanley Kubrick, Kubrick, Kubrick, Kubrick, Kuman, Kuman. So 2001, A Space Odyssey was released the year before the moon landing. And there's a big moon landing scene in this movie that was shot in a studio. And it looks very, very real. Some people on the Internet say it looks more real than the real moon landing, which I had questions, but that's their opinion. So NASA realized that the theory goes, sorry, I should not say this is a fact. NASA did not really ever say this. So some say that NASA realized they couldn't do it. And by it, I mean do the moon landing. So they were big fans of 2001 A Space Odyssey and contacted Mr. Kubrick Kubrick and asked him if he could recreate his moon landing scene and so that they would just kill their astronauts and recreate this. And people say that The Shining is Stanley Kubrick Kubrick's confession, because in it, Danny, the son wears an Apollo 11 sweater. That's it.

Matt: [00:46:58] That's it. That's that's the theory. Well, I mean, in The Princess Bride, Fred Savage is wearing a Bears jersey. Does that mean that, like is that, you know, like Rob Reiner's confession, that he's like somehow connected to like the Democratic convention in Chicago back in the day? You know, I mean, they're reaching a little bit. They're conspiracy theorists and just saying and I'm calling you out for reaching like explicitly besides just implying it, that's saying something.

Kelli: [00:47:25] What we're Stanley Kubrick Kubrick's motives, you might ask me.

Matt: [00:47:29] I say Kelli what we're Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick's motives.

Kelli: [00:47:33] Well, some say it was just patriotism that Stanley Kubrick Kubrick wanted us to win the space race. All right. And he was down to do. The others say it was cold, hard cash so he could film Eyes Wide Shut later on. And that's more your theory there. I don't want to because I feel like that's awfully specific. I don't know how else what else would he get funded?

Kelli: [00:47:56] I guess maybe there's only one way that movie got made, and it was that the FBI forced them to make it. All right. Other people do say, and this is the only legit way in my mind because I don't know, he would have to have been given like a bazillion dollars. But some say that the FBI just had some dirt on him. So he just agreed to fake the moon landing with them so that they would cover it up. I don't know. And that's all I really found.

Kelli: [00:48:18] I mean, because he would like not new info ever. Well, here's the thing to right.

Matt: [00:48:23] Like, I just want to go back to the Kubrick thing for a little bit, like he wouldn't have done this all himself. He's not like Robert Rodriguez. That, like, makes the entire movie by himself and would act every single part if he could write, you know, I mean, there's like a ton of people that would be involved, you know, and most of those people are not like people that would be in the Illuminati and like high level. That's the thing about all of this is it's really you have a sound it someone did the sound mix on the lunar landing faking movie. Right.

Matt: [00:48:50] Like there was craft services for that. Like somebody had to, like, make the sandwiches for the fake astronauts and stuff. Right. Like this is, you know, and yeah. You're not going to pay those people off enough now, you know, to keep their mouth shut about what they made.

Matt: [00:49:04] And there was no like it would almost be slightly feasible if like 2001 was being made at the time. And it was like if the theory was, well, shit, he filmed the fake lunar landing while they were making 2001 and people didn't realize they were working on it. And oh shit, maybe that's what happened and that's what happened.

Kelli: [00:49:27] And that's why Janice, the lady with the Italian subs, hasn't ratted anyone out ever. Yeah, she was working.

Matt: [00:49:32] And now it's like how like The Dark Knight was "Rory's First Kiss". Like they don't tell you the movie that you're really making. Yeah. So that was a working time when they film The Dark Knight because like movies like that, they don't when they advertise for extras and stuff like that, they don't use the real name or whatever. So when they were filming The Dark Knight in Chicago, the the fake name of that movie was Rory's First Kiss.

Kelli: [00:49:56] That's all so random. I don't even know how to respond to that. Oh, this was a random fact. I found that I just really loved because a prominent moon landing conspiracists.

Kelli: [00:50:08] Confronted both different levels of reputation and reputation within you have your Redditt dudes, they're low level usually unless a popular one is in there leading a discussion, and then you have your average loonie's and then you have your prominent ones and then you have the ones that are on the speaking circuit.

Kelli: [00:50:25] So many different layers, you know. But he confronted Buzz Aldrin about faking the moon landing outside the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2002, and Aldrin punched him, knocked him out.

Matt: [00:50:36] My favorite. So I just need to point out that in our in our working doc, after we started this, what I was I'm pretty sure actually this is what I was typing when Kelli said I was like I had to look like it was questioning her. I was typing, please tell me that we will talk about Buzz Aldrin punching out a lunar landing denier, because that's like my favorite thing about the entire Apollo program in any way, shape or form, because it's just like buzz is like Buzz gives no fucks.

Matt: [00:51:02] It certainly does not want to be like how I don't I don't endorse violence.

Matt: [00:51:10] I you can punch Nazis. That's OK, I guess.

Matt: [00:51:12] But like I mean, I can tell you landed on the fucking moon and some jamoke from whatever is going to come up and tell you it wasn't true. Man Buzz. Yeah. Haymaker his ass. I mean, even Jesus wouldn't turn that other cheek.

Kelli: [00:51:30] Jesus  punched out a truther about him not rising from the dead?

Matt: [00:51:35] If it was about him landing on the moon. Yeah, OK. I mean, Jesus could be like, yeah, sure, you can deny me rising from the dead. I get it. You know, you need to be skeptical, need to question. And then the person's like, yeah, you know what Buzz Aldrin didn't land on the moon and just be like, I'm fucking knocking your lights out bro. That's how that goes down. That's in the new New Testament.

Kelli: [00:51:52] The new New Testament. I'll have to read. I'm very excited.

Matt: [00:51:55] It's very short. It's basically just one parable and it's Jesus punching out a lunar landing denier.

Kelli: [00:52:01] My favorite part, though, was the newspaper asked the guy who confronted Buzz, got punched by him about the incident. They wanted his comment and his comment was, I still believe they faked the moon landing.

Kelli: [00:52:12] I love his commitment. It's just really proud of him, you know? I mean, he took a punch for his weird cause. Yeah.

Kelli: [00:52:20] So then the last thing I really got into was just some brief research. It's another movie conspiracy or it was a conspiracy. And then they made a movie about it. So it regain popularity was that Hitler and the Nazis live on the moon. There is a movie called Iron Sky, which I had never heard of, but it claimed Hitler and the Nazis went to the moon in nineteen forty five instead of suiciding themselves in their bunker.

Matt: [00:52:42] And then it's sort of like Dr. Evil,

Kelli: [00:52:44] Like back when he goes in, because I just watched the austin Powers trilogy for no reason like a few weeks ago. So great is exactly what. 

Matt: [00:52:54] I'm imagining it like "next time. Gadget".

Kelli: [00:52:59] Yeah, they were supposed to come back in twenty twelve on a big boy shaped spaceship back to Earth, which I think plays into the Mayan apocalypse, which I do also want to talk about in another episode, like not super a conspiracy, but worth it. So this movie claimed that and then it brought up old conspiracies. But this was a very early conspiracy because after Hitler died in his bunker, the Soviets started a misinformation campaign to have people question whether or not he was really dead. And they spread this around at the Battle of Berlin that he was on the moon or that he wasn't really dead. Once the moon landing happened because of the space race and the stuff with the Soviets and all this other stuff, it became that he that's where he went, not Argentina as previously thought and as much more achievable. It's so much easier to get secret it out of your bunker to Argentina. But Hitler dreamed big and he is on the moon with his Nazi brother. And this podcast's official stance is that we do hope all the Nazis are dead. So I don't care if they're on the moon.

Matt: [00:54:04] This podcast's official stance on debunking the do Nazis live on the moon is as follows. No, of course they fucking don't.

Kelli: [00:54:12] Thank you for making that clear. But it is a fun little theory. I did like this theory just because of how it all dovetailed so perfectly. So we have we have everything good here. We have a Soviet misinformation campaign spread throughout the military at the Battle of Berlin that Hitler wasn't really dead. The biggest fear that people really spread about the Nazis in the States and the Soviets and obviously there were many, but they were really scared of their advanced science and technology. So the US was really terrified of this technology they had. So it was really easy to come up with this theory that they had these rockets that could get to outer space well before those existed.

Matt: [00:54:51] But yeah, because so much of our space technology came from folks who were coming from Germany, coming from that, you know, like either fleeing it or whatever. But they knew it there. Right. So I could see. How did you make that connection? And you're like, oh, shit. Like, those are just the ones who came. But like. Maybe there is, you know, people who worked with Wernher von Braun and such, right?

Kelli: [00:55:13] Absolutely. And throughout World War Two in the States, there were huge. I don't want to call them conspiracy theories because I think they weren't. But they were huge fear campaigns and just information spreading about what the Luftwaffe could do and their capacity to get into space and to destroy us. That's how they were going to win. That's how they were going to beat us was their ability to fly their aerial technology. It made approval of using nuclear weapons a little higher in the states at the time. So the government did use this as a way to gain approval to drop nukes because they wanted to know that we were at risk of the same technology. So we had to use it first, was what I found. So it's a lunatic conspiracy that Hitler would live on the moon. But the way it comes about and the origins are just so classic and just like fear based and government propaganda and all the stuff. So it was kind of just really fascinating to see all those things kind of combined together. And now there's a Reddit thread that Hitler lives on the moon.

Matt: [00:56:10] You know you know what Hitler probably has on the moon?

Matt: [00:56:15] What he probably has an air fryer,

Kelli: [00:56:20] Because Hitler's just like, you,

Matt: [00:56:25] OK, I don't know how to get out of that.

Kelli: [00:56:32] How do you get out of that? I guess so, yeah.

Matt: [00:56:34] Anyway, I got an air fryer, so tweet us if you like, have good air for recipes. That's probably what we got here because. Because we're.

Kelli: [00:56:41] So tell me about your air fry or have you tried to make anything yet?

Matt: [00:56:44] I have made one thing in it which was donuts, but they weren't real donuts. But I was looking in the recipe book and I saw donuts and I'm like, oh, and obviously it was like, oh, you make them sick, you have biscuit dough in the refrigerator. And I'm like, oh, so it's like making donuts with refrigerator biscuits. And I will tell you, they turned out really good and they taste really good. They're not donuts. I mean, delicious, they're delicious. So like it's a treat I would would, would make and recommend. But it made me decide that I want to make actual donuts to my er fryer. So sometime in the next week or so I'm going to make some, some like e donut dough and make some, some real donuts. I was very excited to see that it can be a dehydrator so you can make like jerky but it's not huge which means I mean you can't make very much. Right. So that's sort of my thing. I'm like it's like eight hours to make like three pieces of jerky.

Kelli: [00:57:35] Probably each kid will have half a slice of jerky and no more. Right. Due to capacity. Thank you.

Matt: [00:57:42] But I'm excited because it's like, you know, it's good for like making vegetables, like you would make them in the oven. It's no different. Right. Right. The way that I usually make veggies and you know it in the oven on a baking sheet, except that like, it's a little easier to time it, I think, and it's a little more predictable. And the big thing is when I got like has two baskets and you can, which is fun. It is. You can allegedly program them separately and it will sink them so they finish at the same time. So if like if I make and make some chicken nuggets and fries and one of them make the vegetables and the other one and then everything turns out at the same time because I have children, which means no matter what the means are, there will also always be chicken nuggets and fries at almost every single meal.

Kelli: [00:58:29] Is an air or just is it kind of the same mechanism as a convection oven or what?

Matt: [00:58:35] What does it do? Yeah, I mean, it's, I feel like er frying is like a bit of a misnomer because I mean it's not like a deep fryer. You're not going to get the smell just so we're clear. Like it doesn't it's not magic.

Kelli: [00:58:47] I think it just a lot of people enjoy thinking that they're eating something fried, which is good. That's I do too. I love fried food. So if I hear it's an air fryer and I feel like I'm getting a healthy version of something, it's I like it.

Matt: [00:59:00] Yeah. So I don't really know quite how it works. This was a little bit of an impulse buy. You know, it's like people and talking about it. And then my girlfriend had gotten one recently and she was telling me we were at Target and I just was looking at it and she was sort of explaining to me what she's done with it. And I'm like, oh, this could solve some of the things that I do with making meals with my kids and stuff. A lot of making stuff in the regular oven. You know, again, you also add to me a big thing was like, oh, I can make two things, like in an oven style thing that are at different temperatures at the same time, because that's my other problem. I you sit there and I'm like, OK, well, let's see, I need to make chicken nuggets for one kid. I need make tater tots for everybody. But I'm also going to make roast asparagus for most of the rest of us. And I need them all to be done. At the same time.

Matt: [00:59:42] I have one oven and they all are at different temperatures. It's like, well, what's the average temperature among all those three things? Right. How do I make my way through it? And it's never perfect.

Kelli: [00:59:53] So I was like, I think it would be actually super clutch if you had kids. I don't know if I would get one because they're just kind of I don't have the space and they're big.

Kelli: [01:00:01] Yeah. And er Frier did almost kill me once. So did it like fall on it.

Matt: [01:00:06] Did it fell on your head.

Kelli: [01:00:09] I was getting. 

Matt: [01:00:09] I had to figure out how an air fryer could kill you. That was about the only thing I could think of, fell on your head.

Kelli: [01:00:14] And so I was at the work the next day and one of the nurses was like, you might have like just like a mild concussion. And I was like, I don't have time for that.

Matt: [01:00:22] Did somebody have it up on a shelf?

Kelli: [01:00:25] It was over the fridge and I open the fridge door and it wasn't like shoved back.

Matt: [01:00:30] It was sort of like in when you're pulling a prank and you put a bucket of paint propped open door.

Kelli: [01:00:35] And yes, it was like just just not as fun. So anyway, they're my enemies, so I won't ever be buying one because of the time one almost killed me. But no, it would be great if you had kids because turning the oven on for those frozen foods is just kind of a hassle. And then veggies and all that stuff. Yeah. I can see as would be good.

Matt: [01:00:56] It's funny because in the recipe book that it comes with, they're all examples of two things to make at the same time that are well, because that's sort of the thing they're trying to illustrate, like whatever. There's actually one of the things that was in there that I was like, I would totally make that. And I know it's easy to do, but it seems like it'd be easier to do in this. But it was sort of it was just it was just sausage and peppers. It was like you put your onions and peppers in one basket, you put the sausages in the other and you fire it off and now you got sandwiches. And I was like, I could do all of those things. But this is just a lot easier. And justifying it by showing off that I have a two compartment air fryer means I'm more likely to do it, correct?

Kelli: [01:01:35] No, that sounds good. I look forward to seeing your air fryer recipes.

Matt: [01:01:39] I am really scared of my instant pot because those scare me. I have one but I'm like I've used it once you now granted I only got it like a few weeks ago so it's not like that. Like I've had this thing for two years, I've only used it once but I am a little like scared of it. And I made one thing in it and I was sort of like it was anti climate, like I made pot roast in it. But I'm like, you know what, pot roast is better in a slow cooker, which I could use my instant pot as a slow cooker. And that's just what I should have done and it would have been better.

Kelli: [01:02:05] I've never understood the allure of an insta pot. I just don't ever need to kind of pressure cooker things or cook things very quickly. And again, I'm just a single one person and you have three kids, but I don't really understand their function because I could just use a crock pot or the right. Well, that's obvious.

Matt: [01:02:21] To be fair. This is my theory. I do not buy this. This was given to me by my stepmom and say my step mom gave it to me because she bought one like a year or so ago and never, ever used it. So when I was like, oh, she's like, here, I'll give you mine. Got it. It's basically free. So if I don't use it, at least I didn't invest. And my theory was I don't have a crockpot. So I was like, OK, this is something I can have. This is a slow cooker and it can also do these other things if I ever choose to do that. And the only reason I did the pot roast in the pressure cooker was I was like, I want to see what this does, but I would probably never do that again. Right. Because I'm like, I would make my pot roast in in a slow cooker, a slow cooker. And it's also like, again, what hurry am I?

Matt: [01:03:02] And I work at home right now, like especially now for most people, it's just not right.

Kelli: [01:03:09] I don't know. I think I'm just wary of too much clutter and appliances in my kitchen like I cook so often. I mean, I cook at least one meal from scratch a day and I just don't like a lot of stuff or clutter. And I find that I don't ever end up using these things often enough to make it worth their while. So I'm not sure talking to them. I think it's awesome that you got them.

Matt: [01:03:27] I over rotated on this stuff because of that, because I moved into it. I don't have a kitchen in my house, but it's bigger. 

Kelli: [01:03:34] You have a beautiful kitchen, so beautifully colored,

Matt: [01:03:37] At least for another month or so getting painted. But like, I was so excited that I'm like I actually have room and I can have room to have like a stand mixer now and everything. But then it's like, oh, of course I can have this because I, I can have this, I can have this. And then suddenly you're like, no asshole. You don't have that much more room, you have some more room, but not enough to have all the things. But I was just excited to be able to have some room to have the things and not have it. Not fun taking up space on my counter and clutter.

Kelli: [01:04:03] Yeah. That kind of stuff. So but my one ride or die like cannot live without food appliance. If you have limited space and your limited budget does get a really nice top of the line food processor, it does so much. It's really like four appliances in one. It can do anything then you don't have to have maybe the nicest blender if you're not like making smoothies every day, whatever, you can use the food processor to puree all your foods. It shredded cheese, it does everything.

Matt: [01:04:29] So that's like the one thing I use I am not regretting, but I am bemoaning not having a food processor lately because I didn't have one in my apartment and have a lot of room for stuff and I was buying things and all this nonsense. The problem is I've been wanting to do these things too. But like this is all happening, as you may or may not know, is listen to this podcast. I just bought this house last month. And let me tell you, the holidays are not the time to go to try to buy small kitchen appliances because they are all sold out because everybody bought each other stand mixers and food processors and all these things. I think we'll have to we'll have to come back to more appliance talk in the.

Kelli: [01:05:07] Future, but maybe some more fun food talk in the future. I was kind of slacking.

Matt: [01:05:12] Yeah, we were we were lower on food content. We had a lot more last time because we had all the cereal draft took up a fair amount of time. That was that was some of our most like. Well, not well-received, but people really had thoughts about the cereal draft.

Kelli: [01:05:25] They did. I liked it and liked everyone's comments.

Matt: [01:05:28] I mean, not I like the engagement because it makes me sound like a social media manager.

Kelli: [01:05:33] You are.

Matt: [01:05:36] I'm only half of it. I just told Kelli she could manage her Instagram account. Kelli is like, should we have an Insta? I'm like, go do that.

Kelli: [01:05:44] I was like, fuck, that's not like shit. That's the whole thing for. But I'm very excited to do our own stuff. No, we'll be fun.

Kelli: [01:05:56] I can't wait till the first time I post something from the wrong account. I was just going to say it'll be within hours.

Matt: [01:06:02] If not, I want to know if people if people have bets on the over under to when this turns into a 90 day fiance podcast.

Kelli: [01:06:08] Would the people be upset. What kind of content are you looking for?

Matt: [01:06:15] Let us know on Twitter at Quiche-Anon or on Instagram at Quiche-Anon.

Kelli: [01:06:18] I actually almost watched 90 day fiancee from Sunday before we recorded this and then realized I couldn't because I would have just I would have intermingled on the subject.

Kelli: [01:06:28] Maybe we'll try that next time they have the gas from Russia. It would have been so confusing.

Matt: [01:06:32] See, I'm telling you, though, maybe that's a good thing. I don't know. Let's we'll have to try it. But at a future episode, because, number one, you didn't actually watch it. So there's that. And also we are more than out of time.

Kelli: [01:06:46] So sorry for don't be sorry.

Matt: [01:06:49] You gave we gave the people extra.

Matt: [01:06:52] It was bonus content.

Kelli: [01:06:54] Bonus content on content, guys. Bonus bonus. Yeah.

Kelli: [01:06:58] Who doesn't have 90 minutes to kill do we do.

Matt: [01:07:04] But with that take take the things you learned about the moon landing. And by the way, the most thing you should learn about the moon landing is yes, we did go to the moon and no Nazis do not live on the moon with or without air Fryer's or condensed milk or condensed milk.

Matt: [01:07:21] As always, I'm Matt. 

Kelli: [01:07:24] And I'm Kelli.

Kelli: [01:07:25] This is Quiche-Anon. And remember that the truth and the tacos are out there.
