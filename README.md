## Pull Request Workflow

There is a GitHub Action that runs on all PRs that contain changed images, which will optimize any images in the repo that need it.

## Theme

The Hugo theme used is [Castanet](https://www.github.com/mattstratton/castanet).

### Updating the theme

If there are new versions of [Castanet](https://www.github.com/mattstratton/castanet), all that should be required is to replace the entire `themes/castanet` directory with the new downloaded version. Check out [utils/README.md](https://github.com/mattstratton/quiche-anon/blob/master/utils/README.md) for a helpful script to do this in a fancy automated way.
